# Introduction

## Gameplay

**Snake** is a simple game where the player has to move a snake by choosing a direction (up, down, left, or right). Each time the snake eats a fruit it grows by one unit in size. The goal is to continually grow the snake till it occupies all available (game) play-space. However, the game ends if the snake eats a part of its own body or hits the invisible walls (play-space borders).
