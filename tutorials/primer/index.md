# The Shards Primer

This document is a step-by-step guide for the beginning Shards developer. It explains the basic concepts underlying the language and will get you started with writing Shards code.

Shards has a very visual code syntax so prior programming experience is not mandatory to start coding in Shards. Also, we shall cover any required programming concepts as we go along.

Once you're done with this primer you may want to check out our [tutorials](https://learn.fragcolor.xyz/) and [code examples](https://learn.fragcolor.xyz/code-examples) (coming soon).

For language reference documentation, head over to the [shards](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/) documentation.
