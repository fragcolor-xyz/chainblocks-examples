# Manipulating data

Data manipulation is the sole reason for a computer program to exist. In this section, we take a look at how Shards code understands and manipulates data.

!!! note
    This section talks specifically about manipulating data *within* a wire or a shard. For other use cases refer to [macros](#macros) and the [appendix D - Mal/EDN](#appendix-d-maledn).

## Data types and values

Data comes in many forms and we call these forms *data types*. For example, *4* is a number type while *"Hello there"* is a string type (block of text).

While a data type is a description of the kind of data under consideration, a *value* is an actual data value. These are also called *literals*. So, *4* is a literal and its data type is numeric.

Literals that are used frequently have their own names - like `nil`, `true`, `false`, etc. These are called named literals.

Both data type names and literal names are reserved keywords - i.e., they're used by the programming language and programmer is not allowed to use these for naming new stuff in their code.

!!! note
    While declaring these named literals, you may choose to drop the `Const` keyword (implicit declaration) or use it (explicit declaration). Both methods are equivalent but explicit declaration is recommended. We'll dig more into these literals and how to use them in later sections.

Types are important because they tell a shard what kind of data to expect/process. So if a shard receives a wrong data type it can immediately discard it and raise an error to the user to pass the correct data type. This helps in reducing runtime errors caused due to a shard trying to transform an incorrect data type.

For example, imagine passing text to a shard that sums up numbers: it will not know what to do because mathematical summation does not work on text characters.

Let's look at some of these data types and literals.

!!! note
    In this section, we discuss only the common data types in Shards. For the complete list of supported data types see [types](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/types/). Also, some of these types are available only for internal use by shards (i.e., a programmer may not define and use them explicitly in their code).


```{.clojure .annotate linenums="1"}
;; named literal - denotes nill, nothing, none
nil                         ;; implicit declaration without keyword `Const`
(Const nil)                 ;; explicit declaration using keyword `Const`

;; named literals - boolean true, boolean false
true                        ;; denotes 'truth', evaluates to 1 in boolean logic (implicit declaration)
(Const true)                ;; explicit declaration using the Const keyword
false                       ;; denotes 'falsehood', evaluates to 0 in boolean logic (implicit declaration)
(Const nil)                 ;; explicit declaration using the Const keyword

;; string data - anything in double quotes
"Hello World"               ;; a string literal (implicit declaration without keyword `String`)
(String "a")                ;; single character (explicit declaration with keyword `String`)
(String "House No. #87")    ;; special characters, numbers, spaces
(String "Hello friends!")   ;; blocks of text

;; numeric data - integers (non-decimal numbers)
123                         ;; a single integer literal (implicit declaration without keyword `Int`)
(Int 1)                     ;; single integer (explicit declaration with keyword `Int`)                      
(Int2 10 20)                ;; group of 2 integers
(Int3 2 3 3 )               ;; group of 3 integers
(Int4 9 8 7 6)              ;; group of 4 integers

;; numeric data - floats (decimal numbers)
23.87                       ;; a single float literal (implicit declaration without keyword `Float`)
(Float 1.2)                 ;; single float (explicit declaration with keyword `Float`)
(Float2 2.2 45.1)           ;; group of 2 floats
(Float3 7.0 5.3 4.0)        ;; group of 3 floats
(Float4 7.8 7.5 9.9 10.0)   ;; group of 4 floats

;; a sequence literal (values can be other/nested data types)
[1 "world" 4 ["very" 5] 78]

;; a table literal (values can be other/nested data types)
{:k1 "value1" :key2 ["v" "a" "l" 3] "key3" 450}

;; a color literal (special data type with RGBA channel values)
(Color 100 120 255 0)
```

### Named literals

`nil` represents null/nothing/none in Shards and is an example of a named literal. That means you can use this keyword to indicate a null input or a null result etc. Similarly, the boolean literals - `true`, `false` - represent the truth (`true`) or falsehood (`false`) of an assertion or a conditional check, or an expression evaluation. Since these literals are named as well as fixed in value - they are internally handled as constants (i.e., using the `Const` keyword).

### String type

A [`string`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/types/#string) data type is essentially anything wrapped in double quotes. This is useful for storing blocks of descriptive text or messages.

### Number types

Numbers come in two types - integers and floating-point numbers. Use integers when you do not want decimals and floats when higher precision is required. [`int`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/types/#int) and [`float`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/types/#float) are single numbers, while `int2`/`int3`/`int4` and `float2`/`float3`/`float4` are groups of numbers that are processed together (also called vectors).

For example, in a pole-vaulting competition, a competitor's medal tally could be expressed as an `int`, their weight as a `float`, and the highest point they jumped to as a 3-vector `float3` (in `(xyz)` coordinates). All numeric data types have pascal case aliases. So `Int`/`Int2`,`Int3`/`Int4` and `Float`/`Float2`/`Float3`/`Float4` are valid type names too. 

### Seq type

A [`seq`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/types/#seq) is an ordered list of items that can be accessed by their position or index within the structure (very similar to data type 'array' in other programming languages). The values are enclosed in parentheses and are *not* separated by commas. The items inside a sequence may be of different/nested types. For example, `[[3 4] 24 "down" (Float2 4.0 5.0)]` is a valid sequence.

### Table type

A [`Table`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/types/#table) is an unordered collection of values that can be accessed by specific keys which are also part of the table (very similar to the data type 'object' in other programming languages). The values in the table can be of different/nested types but the keys must be either prefixed with a `:` (a valid key: `:key2`) enclosed in double quotes (another valid key: `"abc"`). Also, tables must always have key/value pairs. There cannot be just a key or just a value. So, `{key24 "val24"}` is an invalid table (because the key is not named properly) and so is this `{:k1 "abc" :k2 :k3 "def"}` (because here the key `:k2` has no corresponding value).

### Color type

A [`color`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/types/#color) is a vector of 4 integers representing the RGBA values (in sequence) for that color. Each value can range from 0 to 255 (any value above 255 is subtracted from 256 to bring it back into 0 - 255 range, as many times as needed). The R, G, and B values represent the amount of red, green, and blue color components and the A represents the *alpha* channel or how opaque the color shade is (0 is fully transparent, 255 is fully opaque). `color` has a pascal case alias `Color`.

!!! note
    Similar to named literal declarations, you may choose to use declare certain data types - like `String`, `Int`, and `Float` - with the type keyword (explicit declaration) or without the type keyword (implicit declaration). Both methods are equivalent but explicit declaration is recommended.

## Variables and constants

As we saw in the last section - a data type is a description of the data while a literal is an actual data value.

It's straightforward to use literals directly:
```{.clojure .annotate linenums="1"}
9 (Math.Sqrt)       ;; takes literal 9 as input
(Log)               ;; outputs literal => 3
```

However, it's easier to manipulate them if you store them in a memory location, give that location a name, then refer to the value via that name. Think of the memory location as a box and the data as an item that can be stored in the box.

Just like you can swap out items from a box; you can change the data inside a memory location. Such a memory location is then called a *variable* or a *mutable variable*.

!!! note
    The initial variable declaration sets the data type of the variable. Once the data type is set you can mutate the variable only for the same data type values. So, if you created a variable by assigning an integer type data value to it, then you can only assign it integers from here on. Any attempt to assign a different data type value (say string) will give an error. 

If you put a restriction on the box that prevents you from changing the item inside it (like say locking the box), then such a memory location is called a *constant* or an *immutable variable*. Once set (i.e., during initial declaration) you cannot change the value of a constant.

In Shards, mutable variables can be created by using [`(Set)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Set/) (alias `>=`) and can be updated by using [`(Update)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Update/) (alias `>`). 

!!! note
    A variable may also be updated by applying `(Set)` again on it (with the new value), but it will generate warnings.

Constants can be declared by using [`(Ref)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Ref/) (alias `=`).

To print the value of a variable you may explicitly log it via the variable name (using `(Log)`) or use [`(Get)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Get/) to first read the value from the variable.

!!! note
    1. By convention use `kebab-case` for naming variables, constants, user-defined shards, etc.
    2. All variables and constants names (declared with a wire/shard) should start with a period `.`.
    3. All data-type names, named literals, built-in shards names are reserved keywords in Shards and these many not be used to name variables, constants, wires, meshes, or any other user defined constructs (usually created using [macros](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/functions/macros/)). 

## Creating and updating variables

    ```

## Variable scope

Variables exist within 'scopes'. A scope can be thought of as a field of view within which a variable exists, can be seen by other program elements, and can interact with them.

For example, variables created inside a wire (called *Context variables* or 'ContextVariable') are by default, accessible only to the wire they've been created in.

They can be made accessible to other wires by setting a parameter called `:Global` to `true` in `Set` (this parameter is `false` by default). 

The variables that are accessible across wires or outside wires are called *global variables* and can be said to have a *global scope* whereas variables that are accessible only within the wire they were created in are called *local variables* and are said to have *local scope*.

!!! note "The `:Global` parameter"
    1. `:Global` is available as a parameter across many shards that create, manipulate, or read variables. Its default value is always `false`.
    2. When `:Global` is used with shards that create variables (like `(Set)` or [`(Push)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Push/)) it defines the scope of the newly created variable.
    3. When `:Global` is used with shards that read, update or modify an existing variable (`(Get)`, `(Update)`, etc.) its value is used in conjunction with the variable's name to identify the right variable (since you can have two variables with the same name but different scope). 
    4. Irrespective of the value of `:Global`, variables created within wires *are not accessible outside the wires* (i.e. a Mal/EDN function like `(prn)` cannot read context variables), though the reverse is true (value aliases declared outside wires using `(def)` are accessible by all the wires in that Shards program).

*Code example 17*

    (defmesh root)

    ;; define locally scoped or local variables (i.e., Global is false by default)

        "Local Var" (Set .justvar)                  ;; this .justvar (Global is false) is accessible only within this wire

## Manipulating variables

We have seen how to create and modify certain variables. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Shards contains a large collection of shards to help you modify all the different types of variables that you might use in your program. 

In this section, we will summarize the most important ones. 
    
### Read

To read means to access the value stored in the variable.

- To read immutable or mutable variable values, including a specific key/value pair from a table: use `Get` (especially if accessing global variables across wires)
- To read specific index element from a sequence or a key/value pair from a table: use [`(Take)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Take/) (for both sequences and tables), [`(RTake)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/RTake/) (only for sequences)

### Create

To create is to allocate a new memory location, assign it a name, and store some data in it.

- To declare un-named constants: use `(Const)`
- To declare named immutable-variables or constants: use `(Ref)`
- To create a new/mutable table: use [`(Table)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Table/)
- To create a new/mutable sequence: use [`(Sequence)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Sequence/)
- To create mutable variables, sequences, tables: use `(Set)`
- To create a sequence with a starting value (including empty []): use `(Push)`
- To create a table with a starting key/value pair (including empty {}): use `(Push)`

### Update

To update is to modify the already stored data in a variable.

- To add a new key/value pair to an existing table: use `(Set)`(will generate warnings, but is the cleanest way possible)
- To add a new key/value pair with value as sequence to an existing table: use `(Set)` (avoid `(Push)`)
- To add new elements to existing key/value sequence of an existing table: use `(Set)` (avoid `(Push)`)
- To update an existing key/value in an existing table: use `(Update)`
- To overwrite an existing sequence with a new sequence: use `(Update)`
- To update the value of existing string/numeric variables: use `(Update)`
- To add new elements to an existing sequence: use [`(AppendTo)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/AppendTo/)/[`(PrependTo)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/AppendTo/) if the sequence was created with `(Set)`, use `(Push)` if the sequence was created with `(Push)`

### Delete

To delete is to remove data from the memory location (represented by the variable). 

!!! note
    This only works for data types like sequences (remove some elements from a seqeunce) or table (remove some key/value pairs from a table). You can't really 'empty out' string or number variables. You can overwrite the value in them with an empty-string ('') or a zero (0), but these are also valid values. These variables have not been 'destroyed`. You can still access them by their name. 

- To remove the leading or trailing element from a sequence: use [`(DropFront)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/DropFront/) and [`(Drop)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Drop/) respectively
- To remove (and use) the leading or trailing element from a sequence: use [`(PopFront)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/PopFront/) and [`(Pop)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Pop/) respectively
- To clear out a full sequence: use [`(Clear)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Clear/)
- To remove sequence elements (based on indices) or table key/value pairs (based on keys): use [`(Erase)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Erase/)
- To remove sequence elements that satisfy a certain condition: use [`(Remove)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Remove/)

### Manipulate

Manipulation here refers to some typical operations that change the data value of a variable. 

- To swap two variables values (across datatypes): use [`(Swap)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Swap/)
- To join two strings: use [`(String.Join)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/String/Join/)
- To remove the leading and trailing spaces from string data: use [`(String.Trim)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/String/Trim/)
- To convert all string characters into the upper case: use [`(String.ToUpper)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/String/ToUpper/)
- To convert all string characters into the lower case: use [`(String.ToLower)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/String/ToUpper/)
- To copy out characters (or elements) from a string (or a sequence) by specifying start/end and step values: use [`(Slice)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Slice/)
- To sort elements of a sequence in ascending or descending order: use [`(Sort)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Sort/)

### Typecast

To Typecast is to convert one data type to another (this operation is valid only for certan data type pairs).

- To convert between equal-element integers and floats vectors use: the appropriate `(To*)` shard (for example, to `(Int4)` => `(Float4)`, use `(ToFloat4)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/ToFloat2/))
- To convert an integer/float vector (like `Int2`, `Int3`, ..., `Float3`, `Float4`, etc.) into a sequence: use [`(Flatten)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Flatten/)
- To convert between two unequal integer/float vectors: first `(Flatten)` one of them, then add/remove the required integer and floating-point numbers to match source and destination vector size, then use the appropriate `(To*)` shard (for example, to `(Int2 2 3)` => `(Float3 2.0 3.0 4.0)`, flatten the `(Int2)`, append `(Float 4.0)` to flattened sequence, convert the 3-element sequence to `(Float3)` by using `(ToFloat3)`).
- To convert the string representation of an integer/float to the actual number data: use [`(ParseInt)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/ParseInt/) or [`(ParseFloat)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/ParseFloat/).

### Miscellaneous

Operations that do not fall in any of the above categories are listed here.

- To count characters in a string, elements in a sequence, or key/value pairs in a table: use [`(Count)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Count/)
- To print a string to the standard output (from within a wire/shard): use [`(Msg)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Msg/)
- To print an input string to the standard output along with an optional prefix string (from within a wire/shard): use [`(Log)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Log/)

## Do your sums

Shards comes with an extensive library maths and comparison shards.

For example, [`(Math.Add)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/Math/Add/) will add two numbers, [`(Math.Subtract)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/Math/Subtract/) will subtract one number from the other, and so on for [`(Math.Multiply)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/Math/Multiply/) and [`(Math.Divide)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/Math/Divide/), and others.

It doesn't stop at basic mathematical operations - there are shards that support trigonometric computations, matrix algebra, 3D geometric transformations, etc. 

!!! note
    You can check out all the `(Math.*)` shards by typing 'Math.' in the search box on the [Fragcolor Shards documentation page](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/).

Additionally, the following general comparison shards can compare numeric quantities too:

- evaluate equality (`=`) with [`(Is)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/Is/)
- evaluate inequality (`<`, `>`) with [`(IsLess)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/IsLess/) and  [`(IsMore)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/IsMore/)
- evaluate mixed equality/inequality (`=<`, `>=`) with [`(IsLessEqual)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/IsLessEqual/) and  [`(IsMoreEqual)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/General/IsMoreEqual/)

Here's some code demonstrating usage of these shards:

*Code example 18*

=== "EDN"

    ```{.clojure .annotate linenums="1"}
    (defmesh root)

    (defwire mywire
        4 (IsMore 2) (Log)                      ;; => true

        4 (IsLess 2) (Log)                      ;; => false

        3 (Math.Add 2) (Is 5) (Log)             ;; => true

        10 (Math.Subtract 2) (Math.Add 4) >= .rhsvar1
        9 (IsMoreEqual .rhsvar1) (Log)          ;; => false       

        25 (Math.Divide 5) >= .rhsvar2
        4 (Math.Multiply 2) >= .lhsvar2
        .lhsvar2 (IsLessEqual .rhsvar2) (Log)   ;; => false
        )

    (schedule root mywire)
    (run root 1 1)
    ```
