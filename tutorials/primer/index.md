# The Shards Primer

This document is a step-by-step guide for the beginning Shards developer.

Shards has a visual code syntax so prior programming experience is (desired but) not required to start coding in Shards. We shall cover any required programming concepts as we go along.

Though this guide will introduce you to basic programming concepts and get you started writing Shards code, it will not teach you everything there is to know about Shards (or programming).

Once you're done with this primer, check out our [tutorials](https://learn.fragcolor.xyz/) and [code examples](https://learn.fragcolor.xyz/code-examples) (coming soon).

For Shards language reference head over to the [shards](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/shards/) and [functions](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/functions/) documentation.
