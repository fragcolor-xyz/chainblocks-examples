# Yes-No Game Tutorial

Welcome! In this tutorial, we will be creating a simple game of reflexes using [Shards](https://github.com/fragcolor-xyz/shards).

This tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of Shards. In order to run the code examples used here, you are required to have Shards built. 

For more information, check out the following links on:

1. [The Basics of Shards](https://docs.fragnova.com/learn/shards/)

2. [Building Shards](https://docs.fragnova.com/contribute/code/build-shards/)

3. [Running Shards](https://docs.fragnova.com/contribute/code/run-shards/)

<!-- TODO: reorganize this in order once completed -->
Here are the key concepts that we will be covering in this tutorial:

1. How to create UI and receive User Input

2. How to create variance with Random

3. How to run a Timer

4. How to set up a basic game loop

You can either follow the step-by-step guide, or jump directly to the full game.
