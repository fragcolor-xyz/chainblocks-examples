# Step 1 

## Drawing a Character Image using UI - Overview

Let's start things off nice and easy. In this step, we will simply be:

1. Creating the `GFX.Window`.

2. Drawing our Character Image in the `GFX.Window`.

3. Scheduling our Wire on the Mesh and running it.

## Step 1.1: Readying the Image

Before we can draw our character on the screen, we will need the image file. Any image file will do. If you don't have one, say hello to Glod! Right-click and save the image of Glod below. 

![Glod](assets/Glod.png){ width=100 }

1. Create a folder named "GlodImages" in the same location as where your script will be located.
2. Add your image into the newly created folder.
3. Name your image "Character1.png".

With our image file readied, we can start!

## Step 1.2: Initializing our Variables

First, create the variable `.character-image` to assign our Image file to. Use the shard [`LoadImage`](https://docs.fragnova.com/reference/shards/shards/General/LoadImage/) to load the image into the variable. Set your image's location as its parameter.

 We will wrap this line of code in a `defshards` shard. This shard will be called at the start of our code, where we will be initializing all our variables. 

??? "What is Initializing?"
    Initializing is the assigning of an initial value to a variable when it is declared.

=== "Initialization Code"

    ```clojure linenums="1"
    (defshards initialize-character []
        (LoadImage "GlodImages/Character1.png") = .character-image)
    ```

## Step 1.3: Creating the main Looped Wire

Following that, we will create the main Looped Wire which will be scheduled on the Mesh. The `initialize-character` shard that we have just created will be called at the start of this Looped Wire. It will be wrapped in a `Setup` shard.

??? "The Setup shard"
    The `Setup` shard ensures that every line of code called within it will only happen once. By placing the `initialize-character` shard within a `Setup` shard, we ensure that it is only called once despite being placed in a `defloop`.
    
    We want to initialize variables once only as we do not want our program to continuously create a new instance of the same variable every time the Wire loops. We only need one instance of our variables which will be reused.

=== "Main Looped Wire"

    ```{.clojure .annotate linenums="1"}
    (defshards initialize-character []
      (LoadImage "GlodImages/Character1.png") = .character-image) ;; (1)

    (defloop main-wire
      (Setup
       (initialize-character)))

    (defmesh main)
    (schedule main main-wire)
    (run main (/ 1.0 60))
    ```

    1. `.character-image` is the variable that contains our image.

## Step 1.4: Creating the Window

Trying to run our program right now would result in... nothing. This is because all we are doing is simply initializing a variable. To draw our image on the screen however, we will have to create the window first.

=== "Initialize Code"

    ```clojure linenums="1"
    (defshards initialize-character []
      (LoadImage "GlodImages/Character1.png") = .character-image)

    (defloop main-wire
      (Setup
       (initialize-character))

      (GFX.MainWindow
       :Title "MainWindow" :Width 1920 :Height 1080
       :Contents
       (-> (Setup
            (GFX.DrawQueue) >= .ui-draw-queue
            (GFX.UIPass .ui-draw-queue) >> .render-steps)
           .ui-draw-queue (GFX.ClearQueue)

           (UI
            .ui-draw-queue)

           (GFX.Render :Steps .render-steps))))

    (defmesh main)
    (schedule main main-wire)
    (run main (/ 1.0 60))
    ```

Try running the program now. Something happens! The window that you see was created with the code above. Changing the values in the `:Width` and `:Height` parameters will change the size of this window accordingly.

## Step 1.5: Drawing the Image on the Screen

The last step is to draw the image on screen. To do this, we use the `UI.Area`, the `UI.Image`, and `GFX.Texture` shards.

Create a `load-texture` shard to load our images as textures. This would make it easier for our computer to load the images and ensure that our program runs smoothly even if we use large images.

=== "Code Added"
    
    ```{.clojure .annotate linenums="1"}
    (defshards load-texture [name] ;; (1)
        (LoadImage name)
        (GFX.Texture))
    ```

    1. The `load-texture` shard will allow our images to be loaded as textures.

    ```{.clojure .annotate linenums="1"}
      (UI.Area ;; (1)
       :Position (float2 0 0)
       :Anchor Anchor.Center
       :Contents
       (->
        .character-image (UI.Image :Scale (float2 0.2))))
    ```

    1.  `UI.Area` allows our image to be drawn on screen in the specified area.

=== "Full Code So Far"
    
    ```{.clojure .annotate linenums="1"}
    (defshards load-texture [name] ;; (1)
      (LoadImage name)
      (GFX.Texture))

    (defshards initialize-character []
      (load-texture "GlodImages/Character1.png") = .character-image)

    (defloop main-wire
      (Setup
       (initialize-character))

      (GFX.MainWindow
       :Title "MainWindow" :Width 1920 :Height 1080
       :Contents
       (->
        (Setup
         (GFX.DrawQueue) >= .ui-draw-queue
         (GFX.UIPass .ui-draw-queue) >> .render-steps)
        .ui-draw-queue (GFX.ClearQueue)

        (UI
         .ui-draw-queue
         (->
          (UI.Area
           :Position (float2 0 0)
           :Anchor Anchor.Center
           :Contents
           (->
            .character-image (UI.Image :Scale (float2 0.2))))))

        (GFX.Render :Steps .render-steps))))

    (defmesh main)
    (schedule main main-wire)
    (run main (/ 1.0 60))

    ```
    
    1. Adding `[name]` when creating a shard allows that shard to take in an input variable. Here `[name]` will be used as the input for `load-texture`.

Try running the program now. You should see adorable little Glod in the center of your screen.

Congratulations! You have successfully drawn an image on the screen.

## Recap

In this step, we have successfully drawn an image on the screen by:

1. Initializing an image variable.

2. Creating a window.

3. Using `UI.Area` and `UI.Image` to draw our image within the window.

We would be very hard-pressed however to make a game out of a single static unchanging image. In the next step, we will learn how to dynamically change adorable Glod's image by pressing buttons.

Good job so far and see you in the next step! ðŸ‘‹
