# Tutorials

These tutorials will help you get familiar with Chainblocks.

## Setting up the workspace

We will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) although any text editor could work.

You will also need a compiled version of Chainblocks to run these tutorials. Chainblocks can be [built from the sources](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/code/02.building-chainblocks/).
