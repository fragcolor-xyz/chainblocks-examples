# Step 2

In this tutorial, we will implement a simplified version of the snake game. For now, we won't have high-end graphics but we'll instead focus on the game logic.

## Defining the play space

The snake evolves inside a grid. It moves one cell at a time either horizontally or vertically. The fruit that the snake must eat to grow can appear on any unoccupied cell.

Such a grid may be defined in many ways. We could use a 2D array (or in our case, a sequence of sequences since our grid exists in two-dimensional space). However, to keep our code simple, we will instead use a flat sequence to hold the states of all our grid elements.

The trick is to visualize the 1D sequence as a 2D matrix with defined grid row and grid column values (see code below).

=== "EDN"

    ```{.clojure .annotate linenums="1"}
    (def grid-cols 5) ;; (1)
    (def grid-rows 4)
    (def empty-grid
      [0 0 0 0 0
       0 0 0 0 0
       0 0 0 0 0
       0 0 0 0 0]) ;; (2)
    ```

    1. The [`def`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/docs/functions/macros/#def) keyword associates a value with a name.
    2. `[]` is the syntax to define a sequence of values.

Now, to compute the index of a grid element in that sequence from its 2D coordinates, we can define the following function.

=== "EDN"

    ```{.clojure .annotate linenums="1"}
    (defn get-index [] ;; (1)
      (-> (| (Take 0) >= .x) ;; (2) (3)
          (| (Take 1) >= .y) ;; (4) (5)
          .y (Math.Multiply grid-cols) (Math.Add .x))) ;; (6) (7)
    ```

    1. The [`defn`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/docs/functions/macros/#defn) keyword associates a function with a name. Note the `[]` after the `get-index` name. This indicates that this function has 0 parameters. We will later see functions that do have parameters.
    2. [`(->)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/docs/functions/misc/#shard-container) is a shard container that will group and execute its inner shard(s) in order.
    3. `(|)` is an alias for [`(Sub)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/docs/shards/General/Sub/). It allows reusing the same input across a sequence of shards.
    4. [`(Take)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/docs/shards/General/Take/) returns the value from a sequence at a given index (starting at `0`).
    5. `>=` is an alias for the shard [`(Set)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/docs/shards/General/Set/) which saves the output of a shard into a context variable.
    6. [`(Math.Multiply)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/docs/shards/Math/Multiply/) multiplies its input (written to the left of the shard) with a given value (written to the right of the shard and enclosed within its brackets) and outputs the result.
    7. [`(Math.Add)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/docs/shards/Math/Add/) adds a value to its input and outputs the result.

    ??? note
        Because defn expects a single "value" (called function return value) after the function name and the list of parameters, and our functionâ€™s logic (function body) contains multiple shards, a `(->)` shard is required to group these shards in a single (return) shard. Since this is a common situation with `(defn)` function, a convenient alternative is to use [`(defshards)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/docs/functions/macros/#defshards) instead. A `(defshards)` behaves exactly like a function (including the ability to accept input parameters) but can contain multiple shards in its body. These multiple shards are executed in the order that they appear and the `(defshards)` return value is the output of the last shard in its body.

        ```clojure linenums="1"
        (defshards get-index []
          (| (Take 0) >= .x)
          (| (Take 1) >= .y)
          .y (Math.Multiply grid-cols) (Math.Add .x))
        ```

It can be a bit confusing considering that the function doesn't have any parameters. This is because there is an implicit parameter which is the input.

Since the `(Take)`shard statements start with a `(|)`, they both process the same input (i.e. the implicit input parameter) passed to the`get-index` function. The first statement stores the 0th element of the input (sequence) into a context variable `.x`, while the second statement stores the 1st element of the input into a context variable `.y`.

Similarly, there is an implicit output at the end of the function (the equivalent of the `return` statement in other programming languages) which is also the function's return value.

Let's break down the last line to understand what's happening here.

=== "EDN"

    ```clojure linenums="1"
    .y (Math.Multiply grid-cols) (Math.Add .x)
    ```

- Here `.y` is a context variable.
- Its value becomes the input of the next shard: `(Math.Multiply)`.
- `(Math.Multiply)` takes that value, multiplies it by `grid-cols` and returns the result as output.
- The output becomes the input for the next shard: `(Math.Add)`.
- `(Math.Add)` takes that input and adds it to the value of the context variable `.x`.
- Since this is the last shard of the function, the output of this shard becomes the output of the whole function.

Whenever this function is called, the same processing will happen.

=== "EDN"

    ```clojure linenums="1"
    (int2 1 2) (get-index)
    ```

This time our input is a 2D integer vector represented as a single `int2` value. Inside `(get-index)` each component of that vector will be extracted using `(Take)` (see above code listings).

## Creating a window

We will render our game as a windowed application. Therefore we first need to define a window.

=== "EDN"

    ```{.clojure .annotate linenums="1"}
    --8<-- "tutorials/snake/steps/2-window.edn"
    ```

    1. We have already seen `defloop`, `defmesh`, `schedule` and `run` in [step 1](./step-1.md).
    2. [`(GFX.MainWindow)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/docs/shards/GFX/MainWindow/) creates the application window.

=== "Result"

    ![](2-window.png)

## Adding UI

We will render the game using UI elements. We need to initialize some code to get the UI working.

=== "EDN"
    ```{.clojure .annotate linenums="1"}
    --8<-- "tutorials/snake/steps/2-window-with-ui.edn"
    ```

    1. Boilerplate code to initialize some stuff required for rendering the UI.
    2. [`(UI)`](https://docs.fragcolor.xyz/docs/shards/UI/) defines a UI context.
    3. UI code will go here.
    4. Actual render of the UI.

=== "Result"

    ![](2-window-with-ui.png)

## Let's try it out!

Let's give our function a try. First we will change a few values in the grid to be something other than `0`. And then we will try to retrieve and display those values in our brand-new window. Can you guess which values will be displayed?

=== "EDN"

    ```clojure linenums="1"
    --8<-- "tutorials/snake/steps/2-get-index.edn"
    ```

=== "Result"

    ![](2-get-index.png)
