# What is code?

Computer code is a set of instructions to a computer on how to transform data.

In other words, code is the transformation logic that the computer uses to transform its input into output.

For example, an instruction telling the computer to calculate the square of a number is code.

Also, these data transformation logic blocks can be applied one after the other in a sequence. A sequence like this is also code.

A programming language is a human-readable syntax for writing out such instructions. A set of such instructions (or sequence of instructions) is considered a program or a source code.

??? note "Tech Tip"
    This source code is further parsed (processed and coverted) into a form that the computer understands (i.e. steps in building the source code like compiling, linking, etc.) but a discussion about that is beyond the scope of this text.
