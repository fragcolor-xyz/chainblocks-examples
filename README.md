This repository is a collection of example games and tutorials using the [Shards](https://github.com/fragcolor-xyz/shards) programming language.

Shards is inspired by Lisp and hence is an extremely powerful as well as fun to learn language.

These tutorials are designed to help you learn practical Shards programming step-by-step. Each tutorial covers a few language features, blocks, and functions in the context of building a game from scratch.
